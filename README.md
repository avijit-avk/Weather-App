# Weather-App
Add a city name and get details of the weather

I have used weather api for this project to extract weather data of the location

**Note**
There might be times where this app would not work 
To make this work you can use any of the weather api and make the changes in the javascript variable :
const apiKey = "100a4f3521de48f7936191021252703"; //API KEY 
const apiUrl = `https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=${apiKey}&q=${location}`;

Make sure to update the url according to site from where the Api is taken.
